# Predicting_Stock_Market
This is a project that uses Linear Regression to predict the stock market

This is a project that is meant to use Linear Regression to predict the stock market. I created other features that can help in the prediction. This included features such as avg_5 day closing price, avg_30 and avg_365 and also standard deviation. All these were predictive features used to train our model. More details can be seen in the project.
